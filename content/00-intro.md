Hello. I'm a Software Engineer living in Finland. I code in Rust for a living and for fun.

This blog will content notes about my work and other things I find interesting.

Recently I started to read [Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.html) book by Justin Thaler and I will post my notes about it here.
